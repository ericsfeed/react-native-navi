## What is React Native Navi? 

This repository attempts to create a fairly robust example of app navigation. This is not yet complete but pushing it up as a starting point.

This example includes
* drawer navigation with icons at top level
* tab navigatation for the home page 
* stack navigation for a contact list 
* an example of cross page navigation

Please note,  this version of the repo is not suitable for use as a template.  

### Libaries in Use

* React Native
* Typescript
* Expo

Native Base is included but is not used. 

### Getting Started

cd to the directory
type:
% npm install
% expo start

Most examples I saw failed to document how to setup the types for typescript, but this article covered it.
