## What is React Native Navi? 

This repository attempts to create a fairly robust example of app navigation. This is not yet complete but pushing it up as a starting point.

This example includes
* drawer navigation with icons at top level,
* tab navigatation for the home page,
* stack navigation for a contact list, 
* an example of cross page navigation.

Please note,  this version of the repo is **not suitable** for use as a template.  

### Libaries in Use

* React Native
* Typescript
* Expo

Native Base is included but is not used.

Most examples I saw failed to document how to setup the types for typescript, but this article covered it.

### Testing

This was tested using Expo on iphone SE, Android, and web.  No attempt was made to deploy the code aside from using Expo.
