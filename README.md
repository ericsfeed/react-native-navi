This repo attempts to create a fairly robust example of app navigation. This is not yet complete but pushing it up as a starting point.

This example includes
* drawer navigation with icons at top level
* tab navigatation for the home page 
* stack navigation for a contact list 
* an example of cross page navigation

## Libaries in Use

* React Native
* Typescript
* Expo

Native Base is included but is not used. 

## Getting Started

clone the repo into a directory, 
cd to the directory
type:
% expo start

## what is changed


uses typescript. 

I will probably keep iterating on this until the styles and logic are improved. 

## inspired by

* basic approach

Most examples I saw failed to document how to setup the types for typescript, but this article covered it.
